# Performance-Engineering---Vectra

This Jupyter notebook helps explore the performance metrics from Vectra Recall meta data in version Vectra version 7.x. Vectra doesn't have performance metrics by default and if these are something which are required then this notebook can be used to explore the data and performance of the application and network.
